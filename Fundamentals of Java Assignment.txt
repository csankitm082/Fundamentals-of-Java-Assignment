Answer 1 : A programming language is a set of instructions that computers understand to perform tasks and process data.

Answer 2 : We need programming languages to communicate instructions to computers in a way they can understand, enabling us to create software, automate tasks, analyze data, and solve complex problems efficiently.

Answer 3 : Java features include platform independence, object-oriented programming, robustness, security, multithreading, dynamic memory allocation, architecture neutrality, high performance, distributed computing support, and a rich standard library.

Answer 4 : In Java, an object is a basic unit of programming that represents a specific instance of a class. It contains data and methods related to that class, allowing programmers to organize and manipulate information effectively.
